    "bio": "My name is Kerlin and I am a student at General Assembly. I will graduate in December 2021. Afterwords, I plan on job searching for a few months. Until then I plan on bettering my skills and learning new lanaguages. I want to make more projects once I am done with this course. A little background about me I joined the National Guard at 17 and became a Combat Engineer. I did attend college and had to withdraw due to something personal in my life. I knew I wanted to code somehow and I applied to 2 different bootcamps. Then i found out I was deploying to Morocco and couldnt join any of the 2 bootcamps I applied to, until I was finally able to get into General Assembly this September 2021. Took me a while but I love it so far. I can't wait to become a Software Engineer!"
